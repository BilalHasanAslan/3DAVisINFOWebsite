                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p> Astronomical data are huge in size. When working with such large data sets, it is crucial that memory management is prioritized for scalability as well as obtaining fast process speed for better server response time. For this reasons,
                        This is why C++ was chosen to implement the server; it provides good memory management and is computationally efficient. C++ is also widely utilized in computer graphics applications, scientific or, otherwise and also web applications’
                        servers that require fast response times. One of our primary motives for this project is to build a proof of concept for CARTA which is also built in C++ language.

                        <p> The Server used VTK (Visualisation toolkit), which is a C++ library, for volumetric rendering high resolution data on the server side and encoding it to JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) picture format that will be sent to
                            client side. This library was chosen because it is widely used in scientific volume rendering.</p>

                        <h3>Pre-Processing</h3>
                        <p>
                            Disk reading is a slow process in computers. Reducing this bottle- neck created from disk reading will increase the speed of the server dramatically. FITS file format only provides sequential reading from disk while HDF5 file format provides parallel
                            reading and chunking features. Reading data through HDF5 file format will increase servers’ response speed resulting in a more efficient astronomical rendering system.
                            <p>
                                Mipmaps are different levels of low-resolution cubes of the data. Another way to speed up server performance is by pre-processing these mipmaps before the server and client renders it. HDF5 file format can store different datasets in its file format,
                                allowing it to store pre-processed mipmap datasets. These mipmap datasets are stored in chunks, each of which contains one cubelet. These cubelets dimension sizes are 64x64x64 which makes them 1MB in size. This could be
                                easily changed in the code if different chunk sizes are required.
                                <p>
                                    Since most of the astronomical data is stored in FITS format, a Converter is needed to convert FITS files to the desired HDF5 file format. Diagram below illustrates the process of the converter which converts a FITS file format into a HDF5 file format.
