								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>
									The primary purpose of the client/frontend system is to visualise the data received form the server in the forms
									of image and volume data and to handle and process user interaction with the data.
									It was constructed using Vue.js, a frontend JavaScript framework for the construction of reactive client-side 
									web applications.
								</p>
								<p>
									The client Subsystem was constructed using the Vue.js javascript application framework and allows for easy 
									creation of modular components.
									Additional packages for functionality can easily be added with a package manager like NPM, some of the
									packages that were used are vtk.js which is used for client-side data visualisation and is the JavaScript
									extension of VTK library that is implemented on the server-side system. 
									The Bootstrap CSS package was used to improve the overall aesthetic and user experience compared to 
									default HTML elements.
									To facilitate the connection between the client and the server JavaScript WebSocket are used to 
									send and receive data without having to rely on singular HTTP requests and responses,
									allowing the client to make a single request and receive multiple responses.
								</p>
								<p>
									The client will primarily receive images of fixed size in the implementation this size is 1080 pixels and 720 pixels
									and or one to two data cubes of a fixed which is 64 by 64 by 64 data points per axis.
									These dimensions limit the amount of data that the user will receive, the dimensions can be increased of decreased
									and limit the amount of data the client computer will have to process during its use.
								</p>
								<p>
									The key questions for this section pertain to the design and implementation of visualisation software within
									the context of astronomy, these were:
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>How can the computational overhead of rendering large amounts of data be offloaded from the client
										system?</li>
									<li>What is the limit for the size of data cubes that are rendered by the client system before 
										impacting usability?</li>
									<li>How can the client and server approaches be combined to facilitate high-resolution data rendering 
										over a network while maintaining usability?</li>
									<li>How does the hybrid model approach scale in terms of rendering time, transfer latency, and time 
										from user interaction and feedback over increasingly larger data sets?</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h3>User Interface</h3>
								<p>
									The user Interface of the client system allows the user it access the functionality and interact with the data
									located within the server.
									It consists out of elements that allow the user to access the data on the server in the form of files and data cubes, 
									as well as the high resolution visualisations produced by the server. 
									Mechanisms to manipulate the rendering produced by the client such as changing the colour function so that the 
									volume rendering displays differently or to manipulate it position relative to the camera.

The rendering is interactive and the user can manipulate the volume data by zooming in and out, rotating around x, y, z axes and manipulating the cropping area by clicking and dragging the vertices and planes.
