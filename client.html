								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>
									The primary purpose of the client/frontend system is to visualise the data received form the server in the forms
									of image and volume data and to handle and process user interaction with the data.
									It was constructed using Vue.js, a frontend JavaScript framework for the construction of reactive client-side 
									web applications.
								</p>
								<p>
									The client Subsystem was constructed using the Vue.js javascript application framework and allows for easy 
									creation of modular components.
									Additional packages for functionality can easily be added with a package manager like NPM, some of the
									packages that were used are vtk.js which is used for client-side data visualisation and is the JavaScript
									extension of VTK library that is implemented on the server-side system. 
									The Bootstrap CSS package was used to improve the overall aesthetic and user experience compared to 
									default HTML elements.
									To facilitate the connection between the client and the server JavaScript WebSocket are used to 
									send and receive data without having to rely on singular HTTP requests and responses,
									allowing the client to make a single request and receive multiple responses.
								</p>
								<p>
									The client will primarily receive images of fixed size in the implementation this size is 1080 pixels and 720 pixels
									and or one to two data cubes of a fixed which is 64 by 64 by 64 data points per axis.
									These dimensions limit the amount of data that the user will receive, the dimensions can be increased of decreased
									and limit the amount of data the client computer will have to process during its use.
								</p>
								<p>
									The key questions for this section pertain to the design and implementation of visualisation software within
									the context of astronomy, these were:
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>How can the computational overhead of rendering large amounts of data be offloaded from the client
										system?</li>
									<li>What is the limit for the size of data cubes that are rendered by the client system before 
										impacting usability?</li>
									<li>How can the client and server approaches be combined to facilitate high-resolution data rendering 
										over a network while maintaining usability?</li>
									<li>How does the hybrid model approach scale in terms of rendering time, transfer latency, and time 
										from user interaction and feedback over increasingly larger data sets?</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h3>User Interface</h3>
								<p>
									The user Interface of the client system allows the user it access the functionality and interact with the data
									located within the server.
									It consists out of elements that allow the user to access the data on the server in the form of files and data cubes, 
									as well as the high resolution visualisations produced by the server. 
									Mechanisms to manipulate the rendering produced by the client such as changing the colour function so that the 
									volume rendering displays differently or to manipulate it position relative to the camera.

								<h4>Rendering</h4>
								<div class="box alt">

										<div class="col-6">
											<p>
												The rendering time for data cubes on the client system increases linearly with the amount of data points,
												where as the data cube dimensions increase so does the time required to render it.
												This is due to no being able to discard any region of the data while rendering, 
												each data cube must be processed and rendered and therefore the execution time for the rendering of the 
												data will have an O(n) relationship with the rendering time.
												The largest size the data cube can handle is determined by the individual client computer's specifications
												however limiting the current dimensions of the data cubes to 64 by 64 by 64 ensures the client computer
												will be able to render data cubes in a timely manner by minimising computational overhead for the client system.
												A data cube with the dimensions of 64 render on average under half a second while maintaining a high 
												enough resolution to depict significant structures within the volume data.
												Whereas data cubes with dimensions of 128 will have a higher resolution of the data and depict the structures 
												with more accuracy the number of data points increased exponentially causing the rendering on a single 128 by 
												128 by 128 to be 1.6 seconds on average, three times the duration of the 64 by 64 by 64 cube.
												This time could be decreased with more computational resources but it cannot be assumed the the user would 
												have access to such resources.
												A 32 by 32 by 32 data cube would take less time to render however it will not have high enough resolution
												to represent the structures within the data.

												A data cube with 64 by 64 by 64 dimensions requires on average half a second to render, 
												however, the time for combining the cubes if there is more than one must be considered and added to the rendering
												in order to determine how long the user must wait before interaction can begin.

								<h4>Data cube combination - Number of Cubes</h4>

											<p>
												When combining multiple data cubes of the same size 
												the time each additional cube adds plots the beginning of an exponential relationship.
												This is an undesirable result considering the goal of minimising the waiting time for the user.
												Therefore, within the implementation the total number of cubes the algorithm will have to combine on 
												the client is two.
												Combing two cubes of 64 by 64 by 64 dimensions requires on average 5 seconds and adding the rendering time
												it would produce a visualisation of the data within 6 seconds upon receiving the final data cube.
												This waiting time will only effect the user when initially loading the data and when cropping the cube where
												cubes are transfer from the server to the client.
